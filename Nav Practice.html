            <h3><u><strong>This is the F.R.O.G Home Page</strong></u></h3>
            
            <p><a>You’ve crossed into a realm where the air hums with ancient croaks and the still waters ripple with unseen movements. Here, under the shadow of moonlit lily pads, secrets of the swamp whisper to those willing to listen.<br> <br> You didn’t stumble upon us by chance—the Frog has called you. It always calls. <br>

                <br>We are the Keepers of F.R.O.G, bound by the pulse of the pond and the eternal rhythm of webbed feet.<br><br>
                Every ripple, every leap, every unblinking gaze from the water’s edge is a sign.<br><br> And now, you are part of the Frog’s will.
                Listen carefully. The reeds murmur truths that few dare to hear. In these depths, transformation begins, not of body, but of soul. Once you’ve joined us, the pond will never let you go.
                
                <br><br>Welcome to the Circle. <br><br>The Frog sees you now. 🐸 </a></p>

                <strong><i>He shall see you now.</i></strong> 🐸
                <br><br><strong> Beware, once you click, there is no coming back.</strong>
