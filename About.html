        <h3><u><strong>About</strong></u></h3>
        
     <p><a>There are many rules, the only one I can remember at the moment is that you must always have a frog on you. P.S. Barry and Helen are getting married soon, dress code is green, this can be fully green or green accents. You must have your frog on you to be let in, there will be bouncers on site. No alcoholic beverages and no swearing, there are tadpoles about so you better behave yourselves.</a></p>
